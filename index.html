    <p>Legal Intern | Co-Founder of North South Charters | Full-time Student at USF Muma College of Business</p>
    
    <p>I am a senior at the University of South Florida, graduating in 2026 with plans to attend law school. My background in hospitality and my current legal internship have developed my skills in communication, leadership, and client service. Working closely with a Business Law and Estate Planning firm has sparked a strong interest in the legal field. I am eager to continue learning, take on new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to a growing law firm.
