    <p>Legal Intern | Co-Founder of North South Charters | Full-time Student at USF Muma College of Business</p>
    
    <p>I am currently a senior at the University of South Florida, on track to graduate in 2026 and pursue law school shortly thereafter. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in both the service and legal industries, I’ve developed a deep interest in Business Law and Estate Planning. My progression from entry-level hospitality roles to leadership positions has sharpened my problem-solving, communication, and team-building skills. As a legal intern, I’m gaining practical exposure to the inner workings of a law firm—networking, generating referrals, and supporting client-focused initiatives. These experiences have strengthened my desire to build a meaningful legal career, where I can continue learning, contribute to firm growth, and make a positive, lasting impact on clients and the legal profession.
